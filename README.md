### Our health website is an innovative and advanced platform that aims to provide comprehensive support to individuals seeking to maintain their overall health and wellbeing.

#### Features - 

Prescription Tracker: The platform is user-friendly and allows patients to easily keep track of their prescription details.

Disease Predictor: The most unique and valuable feature of our health website is the ability to predict the chances of any disease based on the user's input. By inputting their symptoms into our website, the platform can analyze the data and provide potential diagnoses based on the user's medical history, lifestyle choices, and other relevant factors.

Chatbot System: We understand that patients may need immediate assistance for their health issues. To cater to this requirement, we have introduced a chatbot system that can provide temporary solutions to the patients' problems.

Disease Information Page: We also provide patients with a dedicated disease information page where they can learn about a particular disease in-depth. The page offers complete information about the disease, including its symptoms, causes, and treatment options. We have also included prescribed medications to be taken, ensuring patients have access to all relevant information in one place.

Virtual Consultancy: Our platform also provides patients with access to health experts virtually. This feature enables patients to receive instant consultancy from our experts in case of any health-related concerns.

Medical Stores Location: Lastly, we have integrated Google map support into our platform, which tracks patients' locations and shows them access to their nearby medical stores. This feature can prove to be extremely helpful, especially for patients who are in urgent need of medication or other health-related supplies.
